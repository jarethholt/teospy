Flu modules
===========

The `flu` modules provide thermodynamic properties of fluid water, both liquid water and water vapour. The primary variables are the temperature and fluid density.

The basic contents of the modules are as follows:

* `flu1` provides the Helmholtz free energy of fluid water.
* `flu2` provides thermodynamic properties that can be derived directly from the Helmholtz free energy in the primary variables.
* `flu3a` provides the Gibbs free energy of liquid water and water vapour separately, with temperature and pressure as variables.
* `flu3b` provides other properties of liquid water and water vapour using temperature and pressure as variables.
* The level 5 modules provide formulations of fluid water properties based on Gibbs energy functions for each phase. `flu5if97` provides Gibbs energy functions for both phases, whereas `liq5f03` provides a function for the liquid phase only.
