Python implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater (2010) for seawater, ice, and air.

The Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater (2010), TEOS10, is a framework for calculating thermodynamic properties of seawater, pure vapour/liquid/ice water, dry air, and mixtures thereof. More information on the framework and scientific background is available at `http://www.teos-10.org/ <http://www.teos-10.org/>`_. The associated software libraries in other languages (Fortran, Visual Basic, C) are available at `https://github.com/TEOS-10 <https://github.com/TEOS-10>`_.

This library is a pure-Python implementation of the TEOS10 Seawater-Ice-Air library. Its purpose is to avoid compiling interfaces to other languages so that calculations can easily be done interactively or as part of a script. This pure-Python implementation also enables using `numpy` arrays and `scipy` optimization and root-finding modules.
